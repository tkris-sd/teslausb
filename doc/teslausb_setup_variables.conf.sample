# Default variables for CIFS (Windows/Mac file sharing) setup
export ARCHIVE_SYSTEM=cifs
export archiveserver=your_archive_name_or_ip
export sharename=your_archive_share_name
export shareuser=username
export sharepassword=password

# if you set camsize to less than 100%, but don't want music to use
# all the remaining space, you can specify how much space you want
# music to use by setting this variable
#export musicsize=4G

# If you want to automatically copy music from a CIFS share every time
# the Pi connects to wifi, set the following variable. The share is
# assumed to exist on the same server as the archive share. It can
# be the same share as the share used for backing up recordings, but
# the folder needs to be different.
# export musicsharename=your_music_share/music_folder

# Wifi setup information. Note that Raspberry Pi Zero W only supports 2.4 GHz wifi
export SSID='your_ssid'
export WIFIPASS='your_pass'

# If doing a headless (i.e. automatic) setup
export HEADLESS_SETUP=true

# uncomment to enable a samba server that exports the recordings
#export SAMBA_ENABLED=true
# uncomment to enable guest access to the samba server

#export AP_SSID='TESLAUSB WIFI'
# Change this! The setup script will not accept the default 'password'
# Also note that the wifi password must be at least 8 characters.
#export AP_PASS='password'
# IP address is optional. The AP will give its clients IP addresses in the
# x.x.x.100-150 range so make sure you don't put the AP's IP address in
# that range.
#export AP_IP='192.168.66.1'

# uncomment if you want to set the time zone to something other than the default 'BST'
# Can be an actual timezone, or "auto" to attempt automatic timezone detection
# export timezone="America/Los_Angeles"

# By default there is a 20 second delay between connecting to wifi and

# TeslaUSB can optionally use the Tesla API to keep your car awake, so it can
# power the Pi long enough for the archiving process to complete. To enable
# that, please provide your Tesla account email and password below.
# TeslaUSB will only send your credentials to the Tesla API itself.
# export tesla_email=joeshmo@gmail.com
# export tesla_password=teslapass
# Please also provide your vehicle's VIN, so TeslaUSB can keep the correct
# vehicle awake.
